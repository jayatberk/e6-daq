notes:
don't worry about input and output folders themselves, they get constantly updated based on what i pass in and then i remove them after every run b/c file names can match. 
integrated mysql as well, but works locally so will have to install that and crate username/pw for it. eventually i think we wanna store locally anyways cause of new server.
